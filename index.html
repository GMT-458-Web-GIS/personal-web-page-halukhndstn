            <h3>Hi, I'm Haluk Hindistan</h3>
            
            <p>4th Year Geomatics Engineering Student</p>
            <p>Junior Developer</p>

            <p>I am a Geomatics Engineering student at Hacettepe University and I am passionate about the field of Geographic Information Systems. As a 4th year student, I am developing myself especially in the field of web-based geographic information systems. Having basic knowledge about WEB programming allows me to advance in this field and motivates me to develop solutions that meet the needs of our age. In addition, I am constantly trying to improve myself as someone who is open to learning all kinds of new business lines and projects, not only in this field; but also in my profession and in the field of programming.</p>
